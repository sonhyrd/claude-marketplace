## [Unreleased]

### Added
- claude-settings skill (sss plugin): `references/external-plugins.md`, the roster of plugins this setup depends on and where each comes from — the manual counterpart to the one region the skill can never sync. `enabledPlugins` is excluded from the baseline by design (marketplace sources differ per machine: a directory source here, a clone there), which means a fresh machine gets the settings merge and *no plugins*, with nothing in the repo recording which ones to install. The roster closes that: four external marketplaces to add (`cloudflare/skills`, `ayghri/i-have-adhd`, `plannotator/effective-html`, `bradautomates/claude-video`), three plugins that need enabling but no add because `claude-plugins-official` ships with Claude Code and is distributed out of band (`commit-commands`, `frontend-design`, `skill-creator`), and this repo's own `sss` / `matt` / `e2e` off a directory source. Enabled plugins only — installed-but-disabled entries are evaluation leftovers and would age badly. It also documents that `~/.claude/settings.json` records plugins in *two* keys that drift apart, `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`, so pruning one without the other leaves the source registered. Deliberately not in `README.md`: that file belongs to upstream `dashed/claude-marketplace` and is titled "Alberto's Claude Marketplace", so a personal roster there is both misattributed and a standing merge conflict. Records why `i-have-adhd` stays installed from `ayghri/i-have-adhd` rather than being vendored into `sss` — copying it in saves one `marketplace add` and costs a fork with no upstream sync path, a duplicated `SessionStart` hook, and a third-party skill in a directory reserved for locally-authored ones, while still not enabling itself on a new machine
- e2e plugin: [sonhyrd/e2e-skills](https://github.com/sonhyrd/e2e-skills) (Apache-2.0) grafted via a real, un-squashed `git subtree add` at `plugins/e2e-skills/` and published as `e2e`, so its skills invoke as `/e2e:pw-prove` and `/e2e:e2e-reviewer`. This retires the standalone clone at `/Users/sondh0127/orca/e2e-skills` and the five hand-made symlinks into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.agents/skills` that were the only way these skills reached an agent — they are now versioned, changelogged and installable like every other plugin here. Unlike `plugins/mattpocock-skills/`, this subtree is **editable in place and bidirectional**: authoring happens here, and `git subtree push --prefix=plugins/e2e-skills e2e-fork main` returns it to the fork; upstream `voidmatcha` commits come in by merging them into the fork from the old clone (kept as a merge workbench, not a source) and then `git subtree pull`. `--squash` was rejected precisely because push re-splits the prefix's history and a synthesized history the fork has never seen is the flaky direction — the cost is 146 grafted commits interleaving two histories in `git log`. Two of the five on-disk skills are declared: `pw-prove` and `e2e-reviewer`. `cypress-debugger`, `playwright-debugger` and `playwright-test-generator` remain as files but are not skills, which keeps `e2e-reviewer/scripts/scan.mjs`'s best-effort import of `playwright-test-generator/scripts/ptg-run.mjs` working; re-declaring one is a one-line manifest edit. Both declared skills carry `disable-model-invocation: true` so neither fires unprompted — that frontmatter field is the only mechanism that pins a *plugin* skill to user-invocable-only, since `skillOverrides` in user settings is inert for plugin-sourced skills. Version starts at a fresh `1.0.0` rather than borrowing the `1.9.0` the four voidmatcha skills carry, because that number describes a five-skill bundle. The directory keeps the name `e2e-skills` because it is the subtree prefix. Known and accepted: `plugins/e2e-skills/CLAUDE.md` is an 11-byte `@AGENTS.md` include costing 15.4K of context in that directory, and `pw-prove`'s SKILL.md still hands off to `playwright-debugger`, which is not a declared skill — left unedited so the subtree does not diverge in a file upstream actively edits
- claude-settings skill (sss plugin): syncs the portable regions of `~/.claude/settings.json` across machines from a repo-tracked `baseline/settings.base.json` — `statusLine`, `skillOverrides` (~50 entries), `permissions`, `attribution`, `includeCoAuthoredBy` — in both directions (**apply** baseline → machine, **capture** machine → baseline). `env`, `hooks` and `enabledPlugins` are deliberately excluded: they carry machine-specific values and absolute paths, matching the existing rule that the Orca/Superset/herdr hooks stay in per-host settings. Merging uses `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'` so unlisted regions survive untouched. Ships `scripts/statusline.sh`, a dependency-free statusline reading *only* Claude Code's stdin JSON — model, `effort.level`, git branch + clean/dirty, context window, cost, `rate_limits.five_hour`, wall-clock — plus an optional `🖥 <label>` segment that renders only when `CLAUDE_HOST_LABEL` is set, so a VPS session is distinguishable from a local one while the primary machine's bar stays short. A plugin cannot ship a main `statusLine` (plugin `settings.json` supports only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`) and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is a versioned, ephemeral cache path, so the script is copied to a stable `~/.claude/statusline-native.sh` and settings point there via `~`, which resolves on both macOS and Linux. Guards: install-time `jq`/`bash`/`git` check, a drift `diff` against the deployed copy before overwriting, and a visible `⚠ jq missing` segment instead of a silently blank bar
- matt plugin: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT) vendored via `git subtree` at upstream version 1.2.0 and published as `matt`, so its skills invoke as `/matt:to-tickets`, `/matt:grilling` and so on, exposing the 22 skills upstream declares — `grilling`, `grill-with-docs`, `grill-me`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `implement`, `tdd`, `code-review`, `codebase-design`, `domain-modeling`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `research`, `prototype`, `triage`, `wayfinder`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `resolving-merge-conflicts`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `ask-matt`, `handoff`, `teach`, `writing-great-skills`. Exactly one upstream line differs (`plugin.json`'s `"name"`, renamed to `matt`) and one file is added (the generated `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, which upstream does not have); every other byte is unmodified, so `git subtree pull --prefix=plugins/mattpocock-skills mattpocock main` merges cleanly; upstream's category-nested `skills/<category>/<name>/` layout is preserved for the same reason. 41 skill directories are on disk but only the 22 upstream exposes are declared — `in-progress/` and `misc/` stay unexposed, as upstream intends
- sss plugin: ships its own hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) so the rtk integration that lived in `~/.claude/settings.json` becomes one tracked, host-portable copy — `rtk.sh` on `PreToolUse(Bash)`. It resolves rtk off `PATH` and is a no-op exiting 0 when rtk is absent, so a fresh host installs cleanly; when rtk is present it `exec`s through so hook JSON and the exit code pass unchanged. Kill switch `SSS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1`; override `SSS_RTK_BIN`. The Orca, Superset and herdr hooks are installed per machine by their own tooling and deliberately stay in settings. This fires *in addition to* settings-level hooks, so remove the `rtk hook claude` duplicate from `~/.claude/settings.json` per host
- sss plugin: three skills moved in from a local fork of mattpocock/skills, where they were authored on top of upstream and could never be pushed. `autoship` — drives an idea or Issue through spec → Issues → Frontier drain to one reviewable PR, with the invoking session as coordinator. `delegate-tickets` — delegates a ticket tree to parallel Orca workers, one child worktree per ticket, dispatched in DAG order from the tickets' blocking edges. `setup-cursor-worker` — one-time machine setup making `cursor-agent` usable as an Orca worker engine, ending in a ready / not-ready verdict. All three require the `matt` plugin and an Orca install; each `SKILL.md` opens with a prerequisites callout, and `jira-ticket` / `release-readiness` remain dependency-free
- sss plugin: personal skill bundle shipping two skills. `jira-ticket` — Story / Task / Bug / Sub-task authoring for the hyrd Jira (project MAMAS), with ticket grammar, `## Description` / `## Acceptance Criteria` structure, a pre-create gate checklist, vertical story-splitting patterns, and a field-review reference. `release-readiness` — read-only report on what is going into the next release (commits since the last release, the Jira tickets they bundle, ticket statuses, blockers, suggested next version); never writes tags, releases, or Jira transitions

### Changed
- New pattern — **a skill's per-repo configuration lives in the repo it configures, not in the skill.** `delegate-tickets` kept its repo profiles in a 25K `PROFILES.md` inside the skill folder, matched by `git remote get-url origin`: measured facts about eight repos, versioned against this one, invisible to anyone working in the repo they described and unamendable by a run that discovered them. They now live as `docs/agents/delegate-profile.md` in the target repo, beside the `issue-tracker.md` / `domain.md` / `triage-labels.md` that `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` already writes there and that `delegate-tickets` step 2 already reads — so the skill is no longer half-migrated. Discovery flips from matching a list to reading a file that is either present or absent; `Remote` is demoted from match key to a self-check warned on, not gated on, since presence-based discovery cannot distinguish a copied checkout from a renamed remote. `PROFILES.md` is deleted outright rather than kept as a fallback, because a two-tier lookup makes "which of these two is stale?" permanent. Applicable to any skill carrying a central table keyed by repo

### Fixed
- e2e plugin: failed to load with `Plugin e2e has conflicting manifests: both plugin.json and marketplace entry specify components.` — the `skills` array was declared in *both* `plugins/e2e-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry, which Claude Code rejects unless the marketplace entry sets `strict: true`. Dropped it from the marketplace entry so the plugin's own manifest owns the skill list, matching the `matt` entry, which has never carried a `skills` key for the same reason. Every other plugin here has no `skills` in `plugin.json`, so their marketplace-side lists are not a conflict

### Changed
- Rename the marketplace from `alberto-marketplace` to `sss-marketplace`. Installs and updates now use the new name (`/plugin marketplace update sss-marketplace`, cache path `~/.claude/plugins/cache/sss-marketplace/`); the generated Codex mirror displayName follows automatically
- Restructure `CLAUDE.md` into a short always-applies section plus task-scoped skills under `.claude/skills/` (`release-version-bump`, `add-marketplace-skill`, `add-mcp-plugin`), so release and authoring guidance loads only when relevant
- Add an `## Agent skills` section to `CLAUDE.md` plus `docs/agents/` config (issue tracker, triage labels, domain docs) consumed by the engineering skills
- Skill discovery in `scripts/validators/validate_structure.py` and `scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py` now walks two levels (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` **and** `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`), so category-nested vendored plugins validate instead of reporting zero skills and tripping `make validate-strict`

### Removed
- handoff plugin: retired in favour of `matt:handoff`. **This is a downgrade, accepted deliberately** — the marketplace's version was an extended fork adding `--workspace` / `--tracked` modes, timestamped `handoff-<project>-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md` filenames, `.git/info/exclude` handling, verifiable-state anchors, a `references/handoff-template.md`, and a "when NOT to use this" section. None of that exists upstream. `changelogs/handoff.md` is kept as a record
- teach plugin: retired alongside `handoff`. **`matt:teach` is not a replacement** — it shares only the name. Upstream's teaches a concept within the workspace; the removed skill (ported from alexknowshtml, unlicensed credited port) ran a Socratic quiz loop over `~/.claude/projects/` session history with a per-concept mastery checklist. That capability is no longer shipped. `changelogs/teach.md` is kept as a record

### Fixed
- Regenerate stale Codex plugin manifests: add missing `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for `model-routing` and `code-walkthrough`, and refresh drifted cachebuster hashes for `agent-skill-init`, `git-absorb`, `linear`, `skill-creator`, `skill-reviewer`, `sqlite`, and `tmux` (`make check-codex-plugins` now clean)

## [0.45.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- code-walkthrough skill: create self-contained interactive HTML documents that teach a code change (branch, PR, diff, or subsystem) to a reviewer with no prior knowledge — before/after code toggles, mermaid diagrams, step-through code walkers, playground widgets mirroring the logic under study, sidebar scrollspy, and light/dark themes. Encodes a 6-phase pipeline (extract via read-only agent fan-out → independently verify claims → spiral pedagogy structure → author in fragments → browser-verify with a headless browser → deliver) and ships a generic, domain-agnostic HTML shell template (`references/template-shell.html`) with the full CSS/JS component library and documented usage patterns

## [0.44.0] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- model-routing skill (1.1.0): mandatory hard timeouts on every codex invocation, from a production incident (two `codex exec` chains hung 5+ hours at ~0.1 s CPU on dead network waits — a hung exec is indistinguishable from a quietly-working one, and a relay wrapper blocked on the Bash call can't even report status). Every example now ships wrapped in `timeout` (900 s implementation / 300 s read-only); new "Timeouts and hangs" reference section with the CPU-time-vs-process-age forensic and kill-the-whole-chain recovery; wrapper-agent pattern now requires the timeout rule verbatim in the wrapper prompt and one-codex-task-per-wrapper (or checkpoint reports). Also documents codex's built-in deadlines (`stream_idle_timeout_ms` 5 min, `stream_max_retries` 5, `request_max_retries` 4, MCP startup 30 s / tool 300 s — verified in the codex source) and why an external `timeout` is still required: the observed hangs happened with all built-ins at defaults

## [0.43.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- model-routing skill: install and maintain a "model routing" section in a project's CLAUDE.md that teaches the orchestrating Claude which model to use for which work — a per-model cost/intelligence/taste rankings table with defaults-not-limits escalation rules, plus the mechanics for reaching each model (Agent/Workflow `model` parameter for Claude models; `codex exec` for GPT models, including the thin sonnet-wrapper pattern for using Codex inside workflows and subagents). Ships a customizable CLAUDE.md section template (`references/claude-md-template.md`) and a `codex exec` flag reference verified against the Codex CLI source (`references/codex-cli.md`). Adapted from Theo's multi-model CLAUDE.md workflow (https://x.com/theo/status/2072481845363822914, https://x.com/theo/status/2072482460122964067)

## [0.42.1] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- fuzzy-filter skill & fuzzy-search MCP: documented the escaped-space (`\ `) phrase idiom and the real code-navigation patterns it composes into. A bare space is fzf's AND separator, so a multi-word phrase (a function/class signature) must backslash-escape its spaces — `'def\ parse_config` matches the contiguous phrase, whereas `'def 'parse_config` matches two independent terms. Added an escaped-space row to both the fuzzy-filter `SKILL.md` and the fuzzy-search `README.md` syntax tables; added a "Code-navigation idioms" table to `SKILL.md` (jump-to-definition `'def\ name`, symbol-minus-tests `'Symbol !tests/`, symbol+area+skip-tests) distilling the shape "exact term(s) with `\ ` for phrases + `!path` exclusions"; and added two combined-operator examples to the `fuzzy_search_content` tool docstring (operators were previously shown only in isolation). Docs only — no behavior or tool-signature change; the backslash is a literal character passed straight to `fzf --filter`, so the idiom works identically on the CLI and through the MCP `fuzzy_filter` argument.
- statusline skill: folded the "Responsive Width-Aware Wrapping" packer directly into the dual-VCS reference script (it was previously documented only as a separate, opt-in section). The script now ends with a greedy segment packer using a *parallel* `seps[]` array — so a wide terminal reproduces the original `model | dir [jj …] [git …] | ctx N%` layout byte-for-byte while a narrow one wraps at segment boundaries — and the reference script now also includes the context-window `ctx N%` segment. Output examples gained the `ctx` suffix and a narrow-terminal wrapped example; Design Notes and the wrapping section were reconciled to describe the now-embedded packer. Mirrors the deployed `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`

## [0.42.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- fuzzy-search skill: `extract_pdf_pages` page cap, configurable via `MCP_FUZZY_MAX_PDF_PAGES` (default 500; `0` disables). Guards against a pathological range (e.g. `pages="1-100000"`) buffering every page's extracted text/HTML at once; applied after deduplicating the requested indices and before extraction (so duplicates don't consume the budget). When the cap trips the result is trimmed and gains additive `truncated`/`truncation_note` keys (the note names the original requested count) via the shared `_with_truncation` helper. Tool signature and existing result keys are unchanged; the default leaves typical extractions byte-identical.

### Fixed
- fuzzy-search skill: `extract_pdf_pages` called `doc.get_page_labels()` (which rebuilds the whole-document label list each call) inside both the per-page range-mapping loop and the per-page extraction loop — O(pages × labels). It is now fetched once and cached right after `fitz.open` (a single O(1) call; on a 10-page label range, measured 20 calls → 1), with byte-identical extracted content and labels.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- fuzzy-search skill: unbounded memory on large result sets. The default `fuzzy_search_content` (standard) path buffered the entire `rg --json` stream plus a full candidate list, mapping, and fzf-input copy at once — amplifying a corpus ~150× (a measured ~20 MB corpus drove ~3 GB Python-side peak), and `limit` only trimmed returned rows without bounding peak. Peak is now bounded by configurable caps and independent of corpus size.
- fuzzy-search skill: `fuzzy_search_files` multiline mode — added the missing `subprocess.check_output` timeout (the only subprocess call lacking one; could hang forever), replaced the O(n²) `bytes += record` accumulation with `b"".join(...)`, and added binary-file skipping, an fzf timeout, and fzf stderr capture.

### Added
- fuzzy-search skill: three env-configurable bounded-memory caps applied before fzf — `MCP_FUZZY_MAX_LINES` (default 100000), `MCP_FUZZY_MAX_BYTES` (default 50 MiB), `MCP_FUZZY_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (default 1 MiB); set any to `0` to disable. When a cap trips, results gain additive `truncated`/`truncation_note` keys (and log a warning) instead of silently dropping data; the `{"matches": [...]}` shape and tool signatures are unchanged. The three search tools' descriptions document these keys so callers can interpret a truncated result.

### Changed
- fuzzy-search skill: the `fuzzy_search_content` standard path reads `rg --json` incrementally from the subprocess pipe (instead of `communicate()` buffering all output) and stops at the cap; the `{file, line, content}` reconstruction mapping is retained (so the existing context/colon-path/encoding fixes are not regressed) but is now bounded by the line cap. `fuzzy_search_files` multiline was brought to parity with the hardened multiline content path, and `fuzzy_search_documents` gained the same candidate cap on its parse loop.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- statusline skill (v1.3.0): "Responsive Width-Aware Wrapping" section — detect the terminal width via the `COLUMNS`/`LINES` env vars (set by Claude Code v2.1.153+, with a `${COLUMNS:-80}` fallback) and wrap a long statusline onto multiple lines with a greedy segment packer that breaks at logical segment boundaries. Documents why `tput cols`/`stty size`/`/dev/tty` cannot work (Claude Code captures stdout, JSON arrives on stdin), the ANSI/OSC 8 measurement caveat, and that the stdin JSON carries no width field

## [0.39.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- agent-skill-init skill (v1.0.0): lightweight scaffolder for creating **repo-local Agent Skills** following the open [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification — distinct from skill-creator and skill-reviewer. Scaffolds the skill directory, writes a spec-compliant `SKILL.md` with valid `name`/`description` frontmatter under `.agents/skills/` (or `.claude/skills/`), and validates the result with `skills-ref`
- agent-skill-init skill: vendored the official `skills-ref` validator verbatim (Apache-2.0, upstream commit `5d4c1fd`) under `plugins/agent-skill-init/skills/agent-skill-init/vendor/skills-ref/` so validation runs via `uv`/`uvx` with no external install; provenance and attribution in `vendor/VENDOR.md`

## [0.38.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- pytest skill (v1.0.0): new skill for the **pytest testing framework** and the Python idioms that set it apart from `unittest` — plain `assert` (rewritten for rich introspection), dependency-injected `@pytest.fixture`, `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, `skip`/`skipif`/`xfail` + custom markers, `pytest.raises`/`warns`/`approx`, builtin fixtures (`tmp_path`/`monkeypatch`/`capsys`/`caplog`), the CLI (`-k`/`-m`/`-x`/`--lf`/`--pdb`/node ids), config (`pyproject.toml`/`pytest.ini`/`pytest.toml`, `addopts`, `testpaths`, `--import-mode`), and plugins/hooks (`conftest.py`, `pytest_*`, xdist/cov). `SKILL.md` (321 lines) + 9 references (fixtures, builtin-fixtures, parametrize, markers-skip-xfail, assertions, cli-usage, configuration, plugins-hooks, version-features). Includes inline `(pytest N.M+)` version annotations — bedrock (stable since pytest 6.x) left untagged, taggable surface from 7.0 — every pin verified against the pytest changelog, plus a `version-features.md` feature→version lookup. Authored against the pytest source tree at 9.1.0/9.2.0.dev0. Built by an opus agent team (TeamCreate) with per-domain authors + a dedicated version-tag auditor.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- handoff skill (v1.3.0): `--tracked` option — git-visible workspace handoffs (cleans up any leftover `handoff-*.md` exclude line, stages the file, offers commit + push as the cross-machine transfer path, `git pull`-aware next-session starter)

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- handoff skill (v1.1.0): `--workspace` option — save the handoff doc to the workspace root instead of the OS temp directory (left untracked/uncommitted unless asked)
- handoff skill (v1.2.0): predictable `handoff-<project>-<timestamp>.md` filenames with a closing path announcement + next-session starter; `references/handoff-template.md` section template (decisions-with-rationale and dead-ends-tried always captured); state anchors + verify-state commands for staleness detection; when-not-to-use guidance (`--resume`/`--continue`, memory vs handoff separation); `--workspace` docs auto-ignored via `.git/info/exclude`. Body no longer verbatim from upstream (core instructions retained)

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- handoff skill: new skill ported from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/handoff) (MIT, body verbatim; handoff skill v1.0.0) — compacts the current conversation into a handoff document for a fresh agent (OS temp dir, "suggested skills" section, artifact references instead of duplication, secret/PII redaction, optional argument tailoring the doc to the next session's focus). Only marketplace divergence: frontmatter description extended with house-convention "Use when..." triggers

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- statusline skill (v1.2.0): jj ⇄ git out-of-sync segment for colocated repos (git HEAD vs jj's `git_head()`, directional `git +N`/`jj +N` counts) and a detached-HEAD fallback (`detached @ <short-hash>`) without which jj-colocated repos never showed the git segment; both live-verified

### Fixed
- statusline skill (v1.2.0): IFS tab field-collapse bug in the jj template parsing made every jj repo show a phantom `conflict` and silently disabled jj ahead/behind — empty template fields now use `-` placeholders

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- linear skill (v2.5.0): `create-project --team <team-key-or-name>` flag — resolves by team key then name, errors cleanly on no match, keeps the workspace-first-team default (now labeled as such with a hint). Closes the multi-team-workspace gap observed during the v2.4.0 live test; live-verified (key resolution, error path, cleanup) against the real workspace
- fuzzy-filter skill (v1.0.1): full fzf extended-search token table (exact-boundary `'wild'`, inverse anchors, batch-mode `--exact` note) and a "Clipboard & editor hand-off" recipe section — batch analogs of interactive fif/fiv-style zsh helpers over `file:line:content` rows (`ffq`/`fifq`/`fivq` functions, single-file field-shift recipes); verified against fzf 0.73.1
- fuzzy-search plugin (v1.1.2): README "Search query syntax (`fuzzy_filter`)" section with the full fzf extended-search token table
- fzf skill (v1.1.1): documented `-e`/`--exact` mode with the `'`-prefix "unquote" footnote; `(fzf 0.55+)` exact-boundary-match annotation and 0.55/0.60 (`--accept-nth`) rows in references/version-features.md

### Fixed
- fuzzy-filter skill (v1.0.1): `--with-nth` does not affect `fzf --filter` output (it only restyles the interactive UI) — the "hide `file:line:` from output" recipe and field-scoping table now use `--accept-nth` `(fzf 0.60+)` with a `cut -d: -f3-` pre-0.60 fallback

## [0.32.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- linear skill (v2.4.1): live end-to-end test of v2.4.0 against a real workspace (every mutating script exercised via marked, immediately-trashed test artifacts) surfaced one bug, now fixed — `project-status` resolved the target status by category type + position only, which picked a `started`-type "To Do" over "In Progress" in a workspace with multiple same-type statuses; `findProjectStatusByType` now prefers a same-type status matching the user's input by normalized name

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- linear skill (v2.4.0): SDK-first overhaul authored by an agent team (2 researchers, 3 authors, 2 verifiers) and verified against the official `linear/linear` monorepo source plus live read-only API checks — `sdk.md` rewritten as a typecheck-verified `@linear/sdk` 86 reference (lazy-relation trap, filtering comparator cookbook, `paginate`/`fetchNext`, `LinearError` hierarchy + rate limits, `rawRequest` escape hatch, file upload, webhooks); tool routing recast as MCP-interactive / SDK-programmatic / raw-GraphQL-last-resort; all bundled scripts moved off raw GraphQL onto typed SDK calls (16 `rawRequest` + 5 hand-rolled `fetch` eliminated, `(client as any)` casts removed, `updateIssueBatch` bulk sync, modern `statusId` project updates, full pagination, typed error formatting via new `lib/errors.ts`); fixed the wrong-team `create-issue` bug, the nonexistent `linear-helpers.mjs` references, broken `sdk.md` examples, and `sync.md`'s fictional CLI. See `changelogs/linear.md` for the full breakdown

### Fixed
- linear skill (v2.3.2): replaced the deprecated MCP connection guidance (`npx mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse` + `LINEAR_API_KEY` env) with the current native HTTP transport (`claude mcp add --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`, OAuth) in `SKILL.md` and `troubleshooting.md` — the old `/sse` config now fails OAuth with a protected-resource mismatch, which is documented along with its fix; corrected dead tool references (`update_issue` → `save_issue`, community-server `linear_search_issues` → `list_issues`) verified against the live official server; removed the varlock step wiring `LINEAR_API_KEY` into the MCP env (the official server uses OAuth, not the key); added `mcp__linear-server` to `allowed-tools`; bumped `@linear/sdk` from `^68.1.0` to `^86.0.0` (latest in the official `linear/linear` monorepo — typecheck, all 66 unit tests, setup diagnostic, and a live read-only query pass on 86.0.0, and the only breaking schema removals in the 76→86 range are unused by the bundled scripts). Diverges the vendored skill from upstream `wrsmith108/linear-claude-skill`

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- uv skill: new skill for **uv** — Astral's fast Python package & project manager (one binary replacing pip/pipx/pyenv/poetry/virtualenv) — authored against the uv source (dev tree past **0.11.20**; the repo's meticulous `CHANGELOG.md` as the primary version source) with every flag and workflow empirically verified on the installed **uv 0.11.2** (uv skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (the four-surface mental model — projects/scripts/tools/python, install + self-update, six verified core workflows, quick-reference, troubleshooting) and four references: `projects.md` (`uv init/add/sync/lock/run/tree/export`, dependency groups (PEP 735) vs extras, `[tool.uv.sources]`, workspaces, `uv version` + bump, `uv build`/`uv publish` incl. trusted publishing, the universal-lockfile model), `scripts-tools-python.md` (PEP 723 inline-metadata scripts + script lockfiles, `uvx`/`uv tool`, `uv python` toolchain management, `uv venv`), `pip-config.md` (the `uv pip` interface + deviations from pip, caching, config discovery (`[tool.uv]` vs `uv.toml`) + `UV_*` env vars, named indexes + auth (`uv auth`), resolution strategies/overrides/constraints/`--exclude-newer`, `--torch-backend` where it actually lives), and `version-features.md` (37 source-cited `feature → minimum uv version` rows (0.4.x→0.11.x, preview features labeled) plus a "Breaking/renamed across 0.x minors" subsection — `uv version` repurposed 0.7.0, `--index-url` deprecation 0.4.23, `uv_build` default 0.8.0, TLS overhaul 0.11.0). Inline `(uv 0.X+)` annotations throughout; bedrock (≤0.4.0, Aug 2024) left unannotated ("unlisted = long-standing"). Writer verification against the live binary corrected several details over the research dossier (e.g. `uv auth` subcommands are `login/logout/token/dir`; `uv sync`/`uv run` have only `--no-dev`/`--only-dev`, not `--dev`; `uv tool upgrade` has no `--upgrade-package`), and the hidden 0.11.20-only `uv upgrade` command was deliberately left undocumented

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- kubernetes skill: new skill for **Kubernetes** — the `kubectl` CLI + core resource/manifest authoring layer — authored against the Kubernetes source (dev tree ~1.37; per-minor `CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.x.md` + the feature-gate stage metadata in `pkg/features/kube_features.go`) with CLI items empirically verified on the installed kubectl **v1.28.2** (client-side; no cluster) (kubernetes skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (declarative desired-state mental model, kubeconfig/contexts, six core workflows — deploy+expose, inspect a failing pod, apply/diff/rollout, exec/logs/port-forward, offline manifest generation with `--dry-run=client`, RBAC checks with `auth can-i` — plus quick-reference and a Pod-status troubleshooting table) and four references: `kubectl.md` (verbs, output formats/jsonpath, client vs server-side apply, rollout, debug with ephemeral containers, drain/taint, explain/api-resources, kustomize, scripting patterns — every flag verified against kubectl 1.28.2 `--help`; documents which `kubectl create` generators work offline and that `run`/`expose`/`autoscale`/`create role` contact the API server even under `--dry-run=client`), `workloads.md` (Pod spec essentials incl. native sidecars, Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet, Job/CronJob incl. podFailurePolicy & successPolicy, HPA v2, PDB, scheduling/affinity/topology spread — field shapes verified against `staging/src/k8s.io/api/`), `cluster-resources.md` (Service/Ingress/NetworkPolicy, ConfigMap/Secret incl. update-propagation caveats, PV/PVC/StorageClass, RBAC, ServiceAccount bound tokens, DNS, downward API, kubeconfig structure), and `version-features.md` (41 source-cited `feature → minimum Kubernetes version` rows annotated by GA version with beta-on noted, plus explicitly-flagged not-yet-GA items). Inline `(k8s 1.X+)` annotations throughout; bedrock (GA ≤ ~1.20) left unannotated ("unlisted = long-standing"). Cross-linked with the k3s skill (k3s = the distribution/cluster layer; kubernetes = everything you run against it)

### Changed
- k3s skill: disambiguation note now points to the new sibling kubernetes skill for `kubectl`/resource usage instead of deferring to "Kubernetes documentation" (k3s skill v1.0.1)

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- sequential-thinking plugin (v1.0.3): audit fixes — corrected the README's advertised tool id to the plugin-namespaced `mcp__plugin_sequential-thinking_sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` form (the README still showed the directly-configured form) and re-synced the README `.mcp.json` snippet with the real file (`--no-config`, added in 1.0.2); added `--no-config` to the script shebang so direct execution gets the same index isolation as the plugin launch path; bounded the `mcp` dependency to `>=1.9.4,<2` (was an unbounded `mcp>=0.1.0` silently floating to 1.27.x while code comments claimed "pinned mcp==1.9.4" — comments corrected, runtime behavior verified unchanged on the current SDK: all 58 tests pass and the stdio handshake succeeds); removed the nonstandard `[project.optional-dependencies]` table from the PEP 723 block. The server script now intentionally diverges from the verbatim `mcp-personal` copy — port upstream to re-converge
- ultrathink skill (v1.1.2): documented the interplay with Claude Code's native `ultrathink` extended-thinking keyword (both can trigger on the same prompt; the skill externalizes reasoning as visible tool calls), made the `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` guidance actionable for plugin installs, and noted the server's `≥ 1` numeric parameter constraints
- Synced `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` versions with marketplace.json across all four MCP plugins (file-search → 1.0.1, fuzzy-search → 1.1.1, sqlite → 1.0.1, sequential-thinking → 1.0.3) — all were stuck at their initial 1.0.0

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **PostgreSQL skill suite** — five focused, non-overlapping skills covering PostgreSQL, authored in parallel by an agent team against the PostgreSQL source tree (dev tree at **19beta1**, so the stable line is **PG 18** and **PG 19** is beta). Every skill mirrors the duckdb gold-standard pattern (a `SKILL.md` spine under 500 lines + a `references/` directory with a source-cited `version-features.md`), carries inline `(pgNN+)` version annotations, and leaves **bedrock** (features stable since the 9.x era) unannotated ("unlisted = long-standing"). All version pins were verified against the in-tree SGML docs (`doc/src/sgml/ref/`, topic SGML, and `release-19.sgml`) cross-checked with postgresql.org release notes — nothing guessed; unsourced features were treated as bedrock.
- psql skill: new skill for **psql**, PostgreSQL's interactive terminal client and SQL script runner (psql skill v1.0.0). `SKILL.md` (325 lines) + 5 references — `meta-commands.md` (the `\d`/`\copy`/`\watch`/`\gexec`/`\if` backslash catalog), `connection.md` (conninfo/URIs, `PG*` env, `~/.pgpass`, service files, SSL/multi-host, precedence), `scripting.md` (agent/CI patterns, `ON_ERROR_STOP`, exit codes, transactions, `FETCH_COUNT`, `.psqlrc`), `pipeline.md` (extended-protocol/pipeline family), and `version-features.md` (33 sourced rows, pg14→pg19). Corrected three commonly-mis-pinned facts via the versioned manuals: the pipeline family + `\parse`/`\bind_named`/`\close_prepared` are **pg18+** (not pg17; there is no `\close` — it is `\close_prepared`), `\getenv` is **pg15+** (pg14 added only `\dX`), and `\watch` sub-features split across pg16/pg17/pg18. Documents `\restrict`/`\unrestrict` as a CVE-2025-8714 security-minor backport (13.22/14.x/15.x/16.10/17.6/18+) rather than a clean major-version feature.
- postgres-sql skill: new skill for the **PostgreSQL SQL dialect & data types** (postgres-sql skill v1.0.0). `SKILL.md` (401 lines) + 6 references — `dml-returning.md`, `queries.md`, `json.md`, `data-types.md`, `partitioning.md`, `version-features.md` (32 sourced rows, pg10→pg19beta). Resolves the SQL/JSON **pg16-vs-pg17** split precisely: pg16 = `IS JSON` + the `JSON_ARRAY`/`JSON_ARRAYAGG`/`JSON_OBJECT`/`JSON_OBJECTAGG` constructors + `ANY_VALUE()`; pg17 = the `JSON_TABLE`/`JSON_QUERY`/`JSON_VALUE`/`JSON_EXISTS` query functions **and** `JSON()`/`JSON_SCALAR()`/`JSON_SERIALIZE()`. Other verified pins: `MERGE` base pg15 with `RETURNING`/`merge_action()`/`WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` pg17; `RETURNING OLD/NEW` pg18; **VIRTUAL generated columns pg18 and now the default** (flagged to write `STORED` explicitly); multiranges + `DETACH … CONCURRENTLY` pg14; recursive-CTE `SEARCH`/`CYCLE` pg14; hash/`DEFAULT` partitions pg11; CTE `MATERIALIZED` + jsonpath pg12.
- postgres-performance skill: new skill for **PostgreSQL query & performance tuning** (postgres-performance skill v1.0.0). `SKILL.md` (362 lines) + 6 references — `explain.md`, `reading-plans.md`, `indexes.md`, `statistics-and-planner.md`, `vacuum-and-bloat.md`, `version-features.md` (~60 sourced rows). Verified EXPLAIN-options matrix: `SETTINGS` pg12, `WAL` pg13, `GENERIC_PLAN` pg16, `SERIALIZE`+`MEMORY` pg17, `BUFFERS` auto-on-with-`ANALYZE` pg18, and a new `IO` option (AIO stats) in **pg19 beta**. Corrects the parallel-query timeline (parallel aggregate + nested-loop/hash joins debuted in 9.6; only Parallel Hash + Parallel Append are pg11) and documents the **pg19 `REPACK`** command deprecating `VACUUM FULL` (with the pg18-and-earlier fallback). Covers the six index types (btree/GIN/GiST/SP-GiST/BRIN/hash), covering `INCLUDE` (pg11), `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` (pg12), and extended statistics (`CREATE STATISTICS` pg10; MCV pg12).
- postgres-admin skill: new skill for **PostgreSQL server administration & operations** (postgres-admin skill v1.0.0). `SKILL.md` (372 lines) + 6 references — `config.md`, `auth-roles.md`, `backup-recovery.md`, `replication.md`, `monitoring.md`, `version-features.md` (84 sourced rows, pg10→pg19). Precisely pinned: incremental backup + `pg_combinebackup` + failover-slot sync (`sync_replication_slots`) pg17; `pg_stat_io` pg16; logical-replication row filters + column lists + `FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA` pg15; `scram-sha-256` available pg10 / default pg14; the predefined-roles timeline (`pg_read/write_all_data` pg14 → `pg_maintain` pg17 → `pg_signal_autovacuum_worker` pg18); `pg_stat_checkpointer` split pg17; `recovery.conf` removal pg12. Mines pg19-beta additions (`effective_wal_level`, `pg_hosts.conf`, `CHECKPOINT` options, non-text `pg_dumpall`, new stat views) from `release-19.sgml`.
- postgres-extensions skill: new skill for **PostgreSQL extension management + the bundled `contrib` catalog** (postgres-extensions skill v1.0.0). `SKILL.md` (319 lines) + 3 references — `contrib-catalog.md` (559 lines cataloging all ~44 `CREATE EXTENSION` modules plus the LOAD-only/preload modules and client programs), `management.md` (`CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP`, the file/`.control` model, catalogs, trusted mechanics, the preload matrix, dump/restore), and `version-features.md` (34 sourced rows, pg10→pg19beta). Key verified facts: `gen_random_uuid()` graduated to **core in pg13** (pgcrypto's copy is now a wrapper); `uuidv7()`/`uuidv4()` core in pg18; **trusted extensions (pg13)** with the 20-module default list taken verbatim from in-tree `contrib.sgml`; `auto_explain`/`pg_overexplain`/`pg_plan_advice` are LOAD-only (no `CREATE EXTENSION`); `adminpack` removed in **pg17**; `pg_surgery` pg14, `pg_walinspect` pg15, `pg_overexplain`/`pg_logicalinspect` pg18, `pg_plan_advice`/`pg_stash_advice` pg19-beta. Notes that a `.control` `default_version` is **not** the PostgreSQL version.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- jq skill: new skill for **jq** — the command-line JSON processor and its filter language — scoped to the CLI + filter language + builtin library, authored against the jq source (jqlang/jq, dev tree past jq-1.8.2rc1) with every example verified on the installed CLI **jq-1.7.1** (jq skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (the filter/stream mental model, install, invocation, seven runnable core workflows — extract with `-r`, `select`/`map`, reshape objects, `@csv`/`@tsv`, slurp+aggregate/`group_by`, `--arg`/`$ENV`, `-f` program file — plus agent usage, quick-reference, and troubleshooting) and four references: `cli.md` (every flag verified against `jq --help`, I/O & slurp modes, the full exit-code set, `$ARGS`/`$ENV`, modules, agent patterns), `language.md` (path expressions, pipe/comma, construction, operators, `//`, `if`/`try`/`?`, `reduce`/`foreach`, variables & destructuring + `?//`, `def`/recursion, `label`/`break`, string interpolation, assignment + path-expression semantics, modules), `builtins.md` (the function library grouped: types, arrays/objects, regex, format strings, math, dates, streaming, SQL-style, debug), and `version-features.md` (35 source-cited `feature → minimum jq version` rows for 1.7/1.7.1/1.8 + a labeled "Removed" subsection). Inline `(jq 1.X+)` version annotations throughout, sourced from the repo's `NEWS.md` cross-checked with the versioned manuals (`docs/content/manual/v1.6`→`v1.8`), git blame on `src/builtin.jq`, and empirical CLI boundary tests; bedrock (≤1.6, 2018) left unannotated ("unlisted = long-standing"). Documents three commonly-assumed features that do **not** exist in jq (`@base32`/`@base32d`, `toarray`, `dateadd`) and the 1.7 removals (`--argfile`, `leaf_paths`, `recurse_down`)

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- duckdb skill: new skill for **DuckDB** — the in-process, columnar, vectorized OLAP SQL engine shipped as a single zero-dependency binary ("SQLite for analytics") — scoped to the CLI + SQL authoring surface and authored against the DuckDB source (dev tree past v1.5.3) with every example verified on the installed CLI **v1.3.2** (duckdb skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (mental model, when-to-use vs SQLite/Postgres, install, the `duckdb` CLI at a glance, six runnable core workflows — direct file query, persistent vs `:memory:`, CSV→Parquet via `COPY`, friendly-SQL exploration, httpfs/S3, `ATTACH` Postgres/SQLite — plus agent-usage, quick-reference, and troubleshooting) and four references: `cli.md` (every flag + dot-command verified against `duckdb -help`/`.help`, output modes, non-interactive/agent patterns), `sql-dialect.md` (friendly-SQL differentiators: FROM-first, `SELECT * EXCLUDE/REPLACE`, `COLUMNS()`, `GROUP BY/ORDER BY ALL`, `QUALIFY`, `PIVOT`/`UNPIVOT`, ASOF/positional joins, nested types + lambdas + comprehensions, `SUMMARIZE`, `USING SAMPLE`, `PREPARE`), `data-io.md` (replacement scans, `read_csv`/`read_parquet`/`read_json`, `COPY … TO` with partitioning, `EXPORT`/`IMPORT DATABASE`, `ATTACH` for duckdb/sqlite/postgres/mysql, the extension system + httpfs/S3 `CREATE SECRET`, and EXPLAIN/PRAGMA/SET ops), and `version-features.md` (47 source-cited `feature → minimum DuckDB version` rows, 1.1.0→1.5.0). Inline `(duckdb vX.Y+)` version annotations throughout, sourced from duckdb.org release blogs cross-checked with git tags and empirical CLI boundary tests (no in-repo CHANGELOG exists); bedrock (≤1.0 GA, June 2024) left unannotated ("unlisted = long-standing"). Documents the verified nuance that database encryption's `ENCRYPTION_KEY` option already works in 1.3.x though documented as a 1.4.0 feature, and the `-readonly`-needs-a-file-DB gotcha

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- jj skill: expanded coverage of the "already-pushed / colocated-repo" reality that greenfield examples never exercised (jj skill v1.7.0) — every claim re-verified against live `jj` 0.41.0 before shipping:
  - **SKILL.md**: new "Colocated repos: Git sees `@` as uncommitted" pitfall (Git's `HEAD` tracks `@`'s parent, so `@`'s changes look uncommitted to Git; `git checkout`/`git switch` and git-based tooling can abort — *only* when the target branch touches the same files — fixed by parking `@` with `jj new <bookmark>`); a one-line "reorder a pushed/stacked branch" pointer in Pushing Changes; broadened the "Immutable commit error" note to include untracked remote bookmarks and to show `--ignore-immutable` in both global and subcommand position; refined the merge-commit pitfall to note empty/description-less `@` auto-abandons.
  - **references/github-workflow.md**: new "Reordering an Already-Pushed / Stacked Branch" recipe (`jj rebase --ignore-immutable -s … -d …` → `jj git push --bookmark …`, which is force-with-lease-safe by default; plain-git `git push --force-with-lease` alternative).
  - **references/commands.md**: documented that `jj squash --from <child> --into <parent>` relocates the child's bookmark onto the parent (with the `-m`/`--use-destination-message` non-interactive caveat), and that `--ignore-immutable` works in subcommand position.

### Fixed
- jj skill: corrected the immutable-commits default in `references/configuration.md` (two sites). The real default is `builtin_immutable_heads()` = `trunk() | tags() | untracked_remote_bookmarks()` — trunk, tags, and **untracked** remote bookmarks — not `trunk() | tags()` as previously labeled "the default". Branches pushed with `jj git push` are tracked (mutable); branches managed by external git tooling (git/gh/git-chain) arrive untracked (immutable). This aligns `configuration.md` with the already-correct `references/revsets.md`. (Note: the source improvement proposal's own wording — "any commit a remote bookmark points to" — was itself inaccurate; verification against jj 0.41.0 established the untracked-only rule, and the invalid `jj git push --force-with-lease` it suggested was dropped since `jj git push` is lease-safe by default.)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- obsidian-bases skill: folded in four stable items from the current official Bases docs that the upstream port omitted (obsidian-bases skill v1.0.1) — each verified against help.obsidian.md before adding:
  - `random()` global function (`random(): number`, refreshes on each view load) in `references/FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md`. Source: https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions
  - `file.file` property (the file object itself, only usable in specific functions) in the `SKILL.md` file-properties table. Source: https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax
  - an Arithmetic Operators table (`+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `( )`) under Formula Syntax in `SKILL.md`. Source: https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax
  - the inline `base` code-block embed method (define a base in a note via a fenced ` ```base ` block) in `SKILL.md`. Source: https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax
  - `SKILL.md` `## Credits` now notes these local additions.
- Deliberately NOT added (could not be confirmed against the official docs): a view-level `sort:` YAML key (docs show only `order`/`groupBy`; sorting is UI-only on the Views page) and Duration `.years`/`.months`/`.weeks` fields (the official functions page has no Duration field table at all). Left out to avoid shipping unverified syntax.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- obsidian-bases skill: new skill for authoring **Obsidian Bases** (`.base` files) — the YAML format that turns notes into database-like table/cards/list/map views with filters, computed formulas, and summary aggregations — ported **verbatim** from the upstream [obsidian-bases](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills/tree/main/skills/obsidian-bases) skill by Steph Ango (@kepano), MIT (obsidian-bases skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (creation workflow; the `.base` schema; filter syntax + operators and recursive and/or/not; the three property types and the `file.*` properties table; the `this` keyword; formula syntax; key functions + the Duration `.days` caveat and date arithmetic; the four view types; default summary formulas; three complete worked examples — task tracker, reading list, daily-notes index; base embedding; YAML quoting rules; troubleshooting) plus `references/FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md` (the complete per-type function reference: global, Any, Date, Duration, String, Number, List, File, Link, Object, RegExp). The reference file is byte-identical to upstream; `SKILL.md` adds only a `## Credits` attribution block

## [0.24.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- obsidian-markdown skill: corrected three details to match the current official Obsidian docs (obsidian-markdown skill v1.0.1) — a first marketplace-local divergence from the verbatim upstream port:
  - **Tag rules**: removed the inaccurate "numbers (not first character)" restriction (in `SKILL.md` and `references/PROPERTIES.md`). The real rule is that a tag must contain at least one non-numeric character (`#1984` is invalid, `#y1984` is valid); also note that most Unicode characters, including emoji, are allowed. Source: https://help.obsidian.md/tags
  - **Property types** (`references/PROPERTIES.md`): removed "Links" from the property-type table — the core set is six types (Text, List, Number, Checkbox, Date, Date & time). Wikilinks are not a distinct type; they are stored inside a quoted Text or List value (the `related: "[[Other Note]]"` example is preserved as a note). Source: https://help.obsidian.md/properties
  - **Embeds** (`references/EMBEDS.md`): added the previously-omitted canvas embed (`![[My canvas.canvas]]`, which renders shapes but not card text). Source: https://help.obsidian.md/embeds
  - `SKILL.md` `## Credits` now notes these local corrections.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- obsidian-markdown skill: new skill for authoring **Obsidian Flavored Markdown** — the Obsidian-specific extensions on top of CommonMark/GFM (wikilinks `[[Note]]`, block IDs `^id`, embeds `![[...]]`, callouts `> [!type]`, frontmatter properties, tags, `%%comments%%`, `==highlights==`, LaTeX math, Mermaid, footnotes) — ported **verbatim** from the upstream [obsidian-markdown](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills/tree/main/skills/obsidian-markdown) skill by Steph Ango (@kepano), MIT (obsidian-markdown skill v1.0.0). Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (creating-a-note workflow, per-feature syntax sections, complete worked example) plus three `references/` files (`CALLOUTS.md` — the 13 callout types + aliases, foldable/nested/custom-CSS; `EMBEDS.md` — note/image/audio/PDF/list/search embeds; `PROPERTIES.md` — property types, default props, tag rules). Reference files are byte-identical to upstream; `SKILL.md` adds only a `## Credits` attribution block

### Changed
- README.md: added a prominent `> [!WARNING]` admonition clarifying that this is Alberto Leal's personal marketplace built solely for his own workflow — he is the only intended/supported user, the skills and MCP servers encode personal conventions and may change or break without notice, and anyone else uses it entirely at their own risk with no support, stability, or backward-compatibility guarantees

## [0.23.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- ansible skill: new skill for **ansible-core** (the agentless automation engine), authored against the ansible-core **2.22.0.dev0** source (latest released 2.21; ansible skill v1.0.0). Covers the ten `ansible*` CLIs (`ansible` ad-hoc, `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-vault`, `ansible-inventory`, `ansible-doc`, `ansible-config`, `ansible-console`, `ansible-pull`, plus an `ansible-test` scope note) and the authoring surface. Ships a `SKILL.md` spine (overview, CLI map, mental model, seven core workflows, ansible.cfg essentials, troubleshooting), `references/cli.md` (shared option groups + per-binary flag reference), `references/playbooks.md` (inventory, playbook anatomy, the source-verified variable-precedence backbone, loops/conditionals/templating, roles, collections/FQCN, delegation, strategies, handlers, tags, check/diff/idempotency), `references/config-vault.md` (ansible.cfg precedence + per-section settings with `ANSIBLE_*` env vars, and the Ansible Vault deep dive), and `references/version-features.md` (37 source-verified `feature → minimum ansible-core version` rows, 2.15→2.21). Inline `(ansible-core X.Y+)` version annotations sourced from maintainer-declared `version_added:` metadata (bedrock left unannotated); documents FQCN (`ansible.builtin.*`), become methods (sudo/su/runas), strategies (linear/free/host_pinned/debug), and that ansible-core ships only `ansible.builtin` (everything else is collections)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- teach skill: new skill that runs a Socratic teaching loop, quizzing you on a coding session until you have confirmed mastery of every concept (teach skill v1.0.0). Sources sessions from `~/.claude/projects/`, tracks a per-concept checklist (Problem / Solution / Broader Context), and never wraps up until every item is confirmed. Ported from the upstream `teach` skill by [alexknowshtml](https://github.com/alexknowshtml/claude-skills/tree/main/teach), itself based on a gist by ThariqS and a teaching concept by Suzanne. Ships a `SKILL.md` spine plus three `references/` files

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- k3s skill: new skill for the `k3s` lightweight CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution, authored against the k3s **v1.35.0+k3s1** source (k3s skill v1.0.0). Covers the `k3s` multicall binary — `server` (~85 flags), `agent` (~45 flags), and the `token`/`etcd-snapshot`/`secrets-encrypt`/`certificate`/`check-config`/`completion` subcommands plus the `kubectl`/`crictl`/`ctr` passthroughs. Includes a `SKILL.md` spine (install, subcommand map, six core workflows: single-server, HA embedded etcd, external datastore, agent join, component disables, day-2 ops), `references/options.md` (exhaustive flag reference grouped by area, with K3S_* env equivalents and Hidden/Exp/Dep markers), `references/recipes.md` (HA bootstrap, airgap, private registries, CNI swap, secrets-encryption rotation, etcd snapshot + `cluster-reset` restore, cert rotation, remote kubeconfig, uninstall, upgrades), and `references/version-features.md` (21 source-verified `feature → minimum k3s version` rows, mirroring the git/fzf/fd/ripgrep skills). Inline `(k3s vX.Y+)` version annotations throughout (bedrock flags left unannotated); documents the `--disable` component set (coredns IS disable-able), token vs agent-token semantics, embedded-etcd odd-quorum, the config-file `.d` drop-ins + `+`-append semantics, and the disabled slice-flag comma-split quirk

## [0.20.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- file-search, fuzzy-search, sequential-thinking, and sqlite plugins (MCP): added `--no-config` to the `uv run` invocation in each plugin's `.mcp.json` so the server always resolves its pinned dependencies from the default PyPI index, independent of the *consuming* repo's uv configuration. Previously, launching Claude Code from a directory whose `pyproject.toml`/`uv.toml` declares a non-PyPI `[[tool.uv.index]]` with `default = true` (e.g. a private mirror) made `uv run --script` adopt that index; resolving `mcp>=0.1.0` (and PyMuPDF) then failed with "not found in the package registry" and every server reported `✘ failed` in `/mcp`. `--no-config` makes uv skip ambient project/user config and use PyPI (file-search 1.0.1, fuzzy-search 1.1.1, sequential-thinking 1.0.2, sqlite 1.0.1)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- fuzzy-filter skill: new skill documenting the non-interactive `rg`/`fd`/`rga` → `fzf --filter` pipeline (the CLI technique behind the fuzzy-search MCP) — SKILL.md + references/pipelines.md (with the exact CLI equivalent of each fuzzy-search MCP tool) + references/pdf.md (fuzzy-search skill v1.0.0). Explicitly disambiguated from the interactive `fzf` skill and the `fuzzy-search` MCP; cross-linked from the fzf/ripgrep/fd skills

### Changed
- fuzzy-search plugin (MCP): hardened the rg→fzf pipeline (fuzzy-search MCP v1.1.0) — `fuzzy_search_content` now parses `rg --json` (fixes advertised-but-broken `-A`/`-B`/`-C` context, colons-in-paths, and encoding), `rg_flags` tokenized via `shlex.split` (quoted globs now work), subprocess timeouts on rg/rga/fzf, multiline skips binaries + avoids O(n²) buffering, PyMuPDF handles closed on error paths, and the stale fzf-ranking `xfail` test was fixed to pass for real. The bundled script now carries documented local patches (no longer byte-verbatim from `mcp-personal`)

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- ripgrep skill: new skill for the `ripgrep` (`rg`) command-line tool (a fast, gitignore-aware recursive `grep`), authored against ripgrep 15.x (ripgrep skill v1.0.0). Includes a `SKILL.md` spine, `references/options.md` (all 104 flags grouped by category), `references/recipes.md` (multiline/replace/custom-types/preprocessing/config/integration), and `references/version-features.md` (feature → minimum ripgrep version lookup, mirroring the git/fzf/fd skills). Inline `(rg X.Y+)` version annotations throughout (long-standing basics unannotated); documents that there is no bare `--hyperlink` flag (only `--hyperlink-format`), `--generate` replaced `--man`, and `--engine` replaced `--auto-hybrid-regex`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- fd skill: new skill for the `fd` command-line tool (a fast `find` replacement), authored against fd v10.4.2 (fd skill v1.0.0). Includes a `SKILL.md` spine, `references/options.md` (exhaustive flag reference), `references/recipes.md` (command execution + tool integration), and `references/version-features.md` (feature → minimum fd version lookup, mirroring the git/fzf skills). Inline `(fd X.Y+)` version annotations throughout, with long-standing basics left unannotated; documents that fd has no `{n}`/positional placeholders and excludes master-only flags not in v10.4.2

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- fzf skill: `references/version-features.md` — a "feature → minimum fzf version" lookup (mirrors the git skill's version-features pattern), and inline `(fzf X.Y+)` version annotations across SKILL.md and all reference files. Versions verified against the fzf v0.73.1 CHANGELOG section headers (fzf skill v1.1.0)

### Changed
- fzf skill: full accuracy/currency refresh against fzf v0.73.1 — documented `--popup` (Zellij support) as primary with `--tmux` as alias, added `dashed` border, `--nushell`, `--preview-window=next`, `--id-nth`, `every(N)` event, footer actions, and the `toggle-wrap-word` default rebind; corrected the `ALT-R`/`toggle-raw` description; documented the smart-case default; hardened the git integration recipes and added a `transform` example; softened the actions.md "complete reference" claim

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- file-search plugin: new MCP-server plugin wrapping the upstream fd+fzf server (`mcp_fd_server.py`, ported verbatim from mcp-personal). Exposes `search_files` (fd regex/glob) and `filter_files` (fzf fuzzy) tools. Bundles the upstream test suite verbatim (`test_fd_server.py`, `test_simple.py`, `test_cli.py`, 49 cases, all passing against real fd/fzf) with a `pyproject.toml` dev extra and a `make test-file-search` target. Requires uv, fd, and fzf
- fuzzy-search plugin: new MCP-server plugin wrapping the upstream ripgrep+fzf server (`mcp_fuzzy_search.py`, ported verbatim). Exposes fuzzy content/file/document search (`fuzzy_search_files`, `fuzzy_search_content`, `fuzzy_search_documents`) plus PyMuPDF-backed PDF tools (`extract_pdf_pages`, `get_pdf_outline`, `get_pdf_page_count`, `get_pdf_page_labels`). Bundles the upstream test suite verbatim (`test_fuzzy_search.py`) with a `make test-fuzzy-search` target. Requires uv, ripgrep, and fzf (ripgrep-all for documents)
- sqlite plugin: new MCP-server plugin wrapping the upstream SQLite server (`mcp_sqlite_server.py`, ported verbatim). Exposes `query`, `execute`, `list_tables`, `describe_table`, `create_table`; read-only by default, writes opt-in via `--allow-writes` / `MCP_SQLITE_ALLOW_WRITES`. Bundles the upstream test suite verbatim (`test_sqlite_server.py`) with a `make test-sqlite` target. Requires only uv (sqlite3 is stdlib)
- Each new MCP plugin follows the established pattern (verbatim server under `scripts/`, `.mcp.json`, metadata-only `plugin.json`, `pyproject.toml` with `pythonpath=["scripts"]`, bundled tests via a `tests/conftest.py` path shim that keeps the upstream test modules verbatim)

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- sequential-thinking plugin: bundled the upstream test suite (`tests/test_sequential_thinking.py`, 58 cases) verbatim from `mcp-personal`, a `pyproject.toml` dev extra, and a `make test-sequential-thinking` target. All tests pass against the verbatim server copy, confirming the port is faithful. Establishes the per-plugin test pattern for MCP-server plugins (mirrors `chrome-cdp` / `react-best-practices`)

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- ultrathink skill: Corrected the Sequential Thinking tool reference to the plugin-namespaced id `mcp__plugin_sequential-thinking_sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` (the form Claude Code registers when the server ships as a marketplace plugin). The previous `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` only applies to a directly-configured MCP server. Documented both forms and the `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>` naming pattern. Verified against the live installed plugin.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- sequential-thinking plugin: the marketplace's first MCP-server plugin, bundling a Python port of the official `sequential-thinking` MCP server (`scripts/mcp_sequential_thinking.py`, a PEP 723 `uv run --script` script) that exposes one `sequentialthinking` tool (`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`) for dynamic, reflective, step-by-step problem-solving
- Establishes the MCP-server plugin pattern: server bundled under `scripts/`, registered via `.mcp.json`, referenced from the marketplace entry with `"mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"` instead of `"skills"`

### Changed
- ultrathink skill: Corrected the Sequential Thinking tool reference from underscores to hyphens (`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`), matching the live MCP server key `sequential-thinking`
- ultrathink skill: Documented the companion `sequential-thinking` MCP plugin as a prerequisite and noted the optional `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` env var
