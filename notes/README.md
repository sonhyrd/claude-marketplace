# Plugin Notes

Meta-documentation for plugins in the marketplace.

## Purpose

This directory contains developer/maintainer documentation about plugins:
- **Technical analysis** - Architecture, design patterns, implementation details
- **Design decisions** - Rationale for choices made, trade-offs considered
- **Testing strategies** - Plugin-specific testing approaches
- **Known issues** - Current limitations, workarounds, edge cases
- **Implementation notes** - Key insights, gotchas, lessons learned

## Directory Structure

Each plugin has its own subdirectory with topic-based documentation:

```
notes/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── <plugin-name>/
│   ├── README.md                # Overview and index

│   ├── design-decisions.md      # Rationale and trade-offs
│   ├── testing-strategy.md      # Testing approaches
│   └── ...                      # Other topic-specific docs
