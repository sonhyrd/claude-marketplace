# Alberto's Claude Marketplace

> A local marketplace for personal Claude Code skills and Codex repo-local skills.

A curated collection of Agent Skills for extending Claude Code and Codex capabilities. This marketplace is configured for local use and makes it easy to install and manage custom skills.

> [!WARNING]
> **This is Alberto Leal's personal Claude Code plugin marketplace.** It is built solely for my own workflow, and I am the only intended and supported user. The skills and MCP servers here encode my personal conventions and assumptions, and may change, break, or disappear at any time without notice or migration path.
>
> You are welcome to read, fork, or borrow from it — but if you are not me, **use it entirely at your own risk.** There are no support, stability, or backward-compatibility guarantees for anyone else.

## Claude Code Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-marketplace

# 2. Install skills
/plugin  # Browse and install plugins → sss-marketplace

# 3. Restart Claude Code to load new skills
/exit
```

## Codex Quick Start

Codex can read this repo as a local plugin marketplace. Generate Codex-native plugin manifests and the Codex marketplace file from the Claude marketplace metadata:

```bash
./scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py
# or
make sync-codex-plugins
```

Then restart Codex or start a new Codex thread from this repo root. Re-run the sync after editing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, plugin skills, or MCP configs:

```bash
./scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py --check
# or
make check-codex-plugins
```

The sync writes `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, each plugin's `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and Codex-specific MCP configs when needed. Generated plugin versions include a content hash so Codex can see a new installable version after plugin files change.

The older direct skill symlink flow is still available when you want repo-local `.agents/skills` entries instead of installing plugins:

```bash
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py
```

For day-to-day toggling, use the interactive manager:

```bash
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py
# or
make manage-codex-skills
```

Useful options:

```bash
# Preview changes without creating links
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py --dry-run

# Replace existing symlinks that point somewhere else
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py --force

# Install links into a personal Codex skills directory
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py --dest "$HOME/.agents/skills"

# List current Codex skill state
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py --list

# Enable, disable, or uninstall individual skills
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py --enable tmux
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py --disable tmux
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py --uninstall tmux
```

By default, the scripts manage `.agents/skills/<skill>` symlinks back to `plugins/<skill>`. `disable` removes only a managed repo symlink, and `uninstall` removes symlinked entries from the Codex skills directory. Real files and directories are reported as conflicts instead of being deleted.

To check and test the Codex scripts:

```bash
make test-codex-skills
```

## opencode Quick Start

[opencode](https://opencode.ai) has no marketplace concept — it discovers skills by recursively scanning configured paths for `**/SKILL.md`, and MCP servers from explicit `mcp:` entries in its config. There is no install script to run; you just point opencode at this repo.

Add an `opencode` block to your global config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",

  // 1. Skills — recursive **/SKILL.md scan picks up every plugin under plugins/.
  //    48 skill plugins are auto-discovered this way. The 4 MCP-only plugins
  //    (no SKILL.md) are skipped here and wired explicitly under "mcp" below.
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["/absolute/path/to/claude-marketplace/plugins"]
  },

  // 2. MCP servers — opencode does not auto-discover; one entry per server.
  //    ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} from each plugin's .mcp.json is NOT interpolated
  //    by opencode, so substitute an absolute script path. "command" is a
  //    single array of strings, not a separate program + args.
  "mcp": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uv", "run", "--no-config", "--script",
        "/absolute/path/to/claude-marketplace/plugins/sequential-thinking/scripts/mcp_sequential_thinking.py"
      ]
    },
    "file-search": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uv", "run", "--no-config", "--script",
        "/absolute/path/to/claude-marketplace/plugins/file-search/scripts/mcp_fd_server.py"
      ]
    },
    "fuzzy-search": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uv", "run", "--no-config", "--script",
        "/absolute/path/to/claude-marketplace/plugins/fuzzy-search/scripts/mcp_fuzzy_search.py"
      ]
    },
    "sqlite": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uv", "run", "--no-config", "--script",
        "/absolute/path/to/claude-marketplace/plugins/sqlite/scripts/mcp_sqlite_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then **quit and restart opencode** — config is loaded once at startup and is not hot-reloaded.

### opencode MCP dependencies

The 4 MCP servers share `uv` and otherwise split their deps:

| Server | Requires | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `sequential-thinking` | `uv` | `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true` env |
| `file-search` | `uv`, `fd`, `fzf` | — |
| `fuzzy-search` | `uv`, `rg`, `fzf` | `rga` (for `fuzzy_search_documents`), `pandoc` (for HTML→Markdown in `extract_pdf_pages`) |
| `sqlite` | `uv` | `MCP_SQLITE_ALLOW_WRITES=true` env, `--db-path <path>` arg |

```bash
brew install uv fd fzf ripgrep ripgrep-all
```

`uv` fetches each server's Python deps (`mcp`, `PyMuPDF`) on first run via PEP 723 inline metadata — do not `pip install` them globally.

### Notes

- Skill plugins (the other 48 directories under `plugins/`) are picked up automatically by the recursive `**/SKILL.md` scan; they need no per-plugin wiring. If a skill appears missing on next session, check that its `SKILL.md` has a non-empty `description` in frontmatter — opencode filters out skills without one.
- If you move this checkout, update the four absolute script paths under `mcp` in lockstep. The `skills.paths` entry only needs the single parent directory.
- For a curated subset of skills instead of all 48, symlink individual plugin dirs into `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/` (opencode auto-loads `~/.config/opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md` and `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`).
- Per-project opencode config (`.opencode/opencode.json` in a workspace) deep-merges over the global config, so you can override or extend `skills.paths` / `mcp` per project.
- Full opencode config schema: <https://opencode.ai/config.json>.

Tool: [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/postgres-extensions) |
| **kubernetes** | Author and operate Kubernetes workloads with kubectl and YAML manifests — the kubectl CLI plus core resource authoring (Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs/CronJobs, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps/Secrets, PV/PVC, RBAC). Use when writing/debugging manifests, running kubectl (apply/diff/rollout/logs/exec/debug), fixing CrashLoopBackOff/Pending pods, managing contexts/namespaces, generating manifests with `--dry-run=client`, or checking RBAC with `auth can-i`. Includes `(k8s 1.X+)` version annotations + a version-features lookup. For installing/running a lightweight cluster see the **k3s** skill. Tool: [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/kubernetes) |
| **uv** | uv — Astral's fast Python package & project manager, one binary replacing pip/pipx/pyenv/poetry/virtualenv. Use when managing Python projects with `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` (`uv init/add/sync/lock/run`), running PEP 723 inline-dependency scripts, running one-off tools with `uvx`, installing/pinning Python versions (`uv python`), migrating from pip (`uv pip`), building/publishing packages, or configuring indexes/resolution/cache. Includes `(uv 0.X+)` version annotations + a version-features lookup. Tool: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/uv) |
| **pytest** | pytest — the Python testing framework and the idioms that set it apart from unittest. Use when writing, running, debugging, or configuring pytest tests — plain `assert` (rewritten for rich introspection), dependency-injected `@pytest.fixture` (scopes/autouse/yield/conftest), `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, `skip`/`skipif`/`xfail` + custom markers, `pytest.raises`/`warns`/`approx`, builtin fixtures (`tmp_path`/`monkeypatch`/`capsys`/`caplog`), the CLI (`-k`/`-m`/`-x`/`--lf`/`--pdb`/node ids), config (`pyproject.toml`/`pytest.ini`, `addopts`, `testpaths`, `--import-mode`), and plugins/hooks (`conftest.py`, xdist/cov/asyncio/mock). Includes `(pytest N.M+)` version annotations + a version-features lookup. Tool: [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/pytest) |
| **model-routing** | Install and maintain a "model routing" section in a project's CLAUDE.md that teaches Claude Code which model to use for which work — a per-model cost/intelligence/taste rankings table with defaults-not-limits escalation rules, plus mechanics for reaching each model (Agent/Workflow `model` parameter for Claude models; `codex exec` for GPT models, including the thin-wrapper pattern for using Codex inside workflows and subagents). Use when setting up Codex/GPT as a delegation target or routing subagent work across models. Ships a customizable CLAUDE.md template and a verified `codex exec` flag reference. | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/model-routing) |
| **code-walkthrough** | Create a self-contained interactive HTML document that teaches a code change (branch, PR, diff, or subsystem) to a reviewer with no prior knowledge — before/after code toggles, mermaid diagrams, step-through code walkers, and playground widgets that mirror the logic under study. Use when the user wants to learn or review a code change interactively, asks for a walkthrough/teaching document of a branch or PR, or wants before/after explanations with visuals. Ships a generic HTML shell template (sidebar scrollspy, theme toggle, component library) and a 6-phase pipeline: extract (read-only agent fan-out) → verify claims → spiral structure → author fragments → browser-verify → deliver. | [dashed](https://github.com/dashed/claude-marketplace/tree/master/plugins/code-walkthrough) |

### Chrome CDP Setup

The chrome-cdp skill requires Chrome with remote debugging enabled and Python 3.10+ with the `websockets` library:

```bash
# 1. Enable remote debugging in Chrome
#    Navigate to chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging and toggle the switch

# 2. Install the websockets dependency
uv pip install websockets
```

### Linear Setup

The linear skill requires Node.js dependencies and a Linear API key:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies in the plugin cache directory
cd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/sss-marketplace/linear/2.3.1
npm install

# 2. Create a Linear API key at https://linear.app/settings/api
# 3. Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."
```

Restart Claude Code after setup.

### Playwright Setup

The playwright skill requires a one-time browser installation (~200MB). Claude will suggest these commands but will not run them directly—run them manually:

```bash
# Install Chromium (recommended, ~200MB)
uv run --with playwright playwright install chromium

# Or install all browsers
uv run --with playwright playwright install
```

## Usage

### Add this marketplace locally

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-marketplace
```

### Update the marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace update sss-marketplace
```

### Install skills

1. Select `/plugin` and then `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `sss-marketplace`
3. Choose the skills to install
4. Restart Claude Code

### Install skills for Codex

```bash
./scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py
```

Codex can then discover the local plugin marketplace from `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` when launched from this repository or one of its subdirectories.

For legacy direct skill links:

```bash
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py
```

To enable, disable, or uninstall skills interactively:

```bash
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py
# or
make manage-codex-skills
```

## Adding Skills to This Marketplace

### Method 1: Add to Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Add your skill directory to `plugins/`
2. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and add a new entry:

```json
{
  "name": "your-skill-name",
  "source": "./plugins/your-skill-name",
  "description": "Brief description of what the skill does",
  "strict": false,
  "skills": ["./skills"]
}
```

**Important:** The `skills` field is required to load skills from the marketplace. It tells Claude Code which directories contain SKILL.md files.

3. Update the CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit your changes
5. Re-run `./scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py` if you use Codex with this repo.

### Method 2: Direct Installation

Skills can also be installed directly without using the Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
# Claude Code personal (available everywhere)
cp -r plugins/your-skill ~/.claude/skills/

# Claude Code project (shared with team)
cp -r plugins/your-skill .claude/skills/

# Codex repo-local links
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py

# Codex plugin marketplace metadata
./scripts/sync_codex_plugins.py

# Codex personal links
./scripts/install_codex_skills.py --dest "$HOME/.agents/skills"

# Codex interactive manager
./scripts/manage_codex_skills.py
```
