# Development Guide

## Task workflows

These live as skills so they load only when you're doing the task:

- **Releasing / bumping the version** → `release-version-bump` skill (`.claude/skills/release-version-bump/`)
- **Adding a new skill plugin** → `add-marketplace-skill` skill (`.claude/skills/add-marketplace-skill/`)
- **Adding an MCP server plugin** → `add-mcp-plugin` skill (`.claude/skills/add-mcp-plugin/`)

## Always applies

- Every change must pass `make validate` before commit, and `make validate-strict` before a release
  (strict mode fails on warnings, which is how missing `plugin.json` files get caught).
- Document user-facing changes under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, prefixing skill-specific
  lines with `<skill-name> skill:`. See the `release-version-bump` skill for which changelog to touch.
- Keep vendored/ported plugin code **verbatim** from upstream — do not reformat it. The lint targets
  deliberately exclude `plugins/*/scripts/`.
- Never reference a plugin MCP tool by its bare `mcp__<server>__<tool>` name; plugin tools are
  namespaced `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>`. Verify the real id after install.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on our fork `sonhyrd/claude-marketplace` (`origin`), not upstream `dashed/claude-marketplace`. Managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root, both created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
